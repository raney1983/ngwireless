The original motivation of this project is to practice some novel ideas and architecture for next-generation wireless system. The first and most important hypothesis is that the builders and operators of next-generation wireless system are no longer the monopoly closed telecom operators. The second hypothesis is that the network's customers have the right to know the true status of the end-to-end wireless system, even if they do not have the right to manage it. The third hypothesis is that networks should have the ability to self-evolve.

This is a battle cry of revolutionaries. Summon like-minded people to join.
